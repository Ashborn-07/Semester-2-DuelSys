already a seasoned developer considering building your own .NET app with GitLab,
this should all look very familiar.

## Minor Requirements - Functional Requirements

_**FR-09: Support leader board**_
Extend the software solution to also support a leader board. When there is an ongoing 
tournament, any interested party (e.g. a sport enthusiast, a player) can retrieve the list of 
players participating in the tournament, ordered based on their current position/rank in the 
tournament.  

## Major Requirements - Functional Requirements

_**FR-07: Support multiple sport types**_
Extend the software solution to also support different sport types (e.g. basketball, tennis, 
quidditch, league of legends, chess, etc.). It should be possible, for a staff member, to 
specify which sport type when creating new tournament. Make sure that when registering 
the result of a game the official scoring rules are followed.
